wallpaper-shuffler
==================

A simple script with GUI (Using Zenity) to configure random desktop background changer. Written in Bash.

The script is configured to autostart at boot.

I was searching for a simple solution for "Random Wallpaper Changer" online, 
when I Couldn't found one I decided to create one myself. My family found it to be easy to use and setup.

Tested on Debian and Ubuntu.

To Install
  Just run the script and follow the instructions.

To Uninstall
  Delete the following files:
    $HOME/.config/autostart/rdeskpics-autostart.desktop
    $HOME/.rand-desk-pics.sh
    $HOME/.pics-to-rand.txt

Easy (:
